"""
service/api.py — FastAPI surface for the nlp-enrich pipeline.

The typed contract (atrium-project#32 round 2). Every route declares its response model and
its error statuses, so the committed ``service/openapi.json`` — attached to every release,
and what the AMČR pipeline generates its clients from — types every field. The models below
DOCUMENT the responses (``response_model=None``): the bytes sent are what the handlers build,
and ``tests/test_api_contract.py`` validates real responses against the published schema.
The parameters with a closed set of values (``lang``, ``format``) are enums in the spec.
Keyword extraction is not part of this service since 1.0.0: it moved to atrium-keyword-extract
(POST /extract_keywords). Refusals carry registered
reasons: an unsupported file type is 415 ``unsupported_media_type``, a record that cannot be
opened is 422 ``invalid_record`` (it was dropped with a warning before). Every JSON success
carries the run's Process Run Crate ``CreateAction`` as ``paradata`` (atrium-project#71).
Regenerate the spec after an API change::

    python atrium_openapi.py export --app service.api:app --out service/openapi.json
