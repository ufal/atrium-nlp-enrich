# NLP enrichment API service

Single-file entry point for the ATRIUM NLP enrichment pipeline (issue
[#8](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich/issues/8)): upload ordered text
lines — a table, a `.txt`, or a TEITOK file converted by flexiconv — get back enriched
**TEITOK XML + keywords + paradata**. The four core
stages (`manifest → udp → nt → stats`) always run; **LLM enrichment is excluded
from every API entry point**.

## Quick start

```bash
./setup_api_service.sh                 # venv + deps + KeyBERT prefetch + serve
# or, manually:
pip install -r requirements.txt -r service/requirements.txt
python -m service.api                  # honours PORT/HOST; default 0.0.0.0:8000
# or, for development with auto-reload:
uvicorn service.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Two-terminal smoke test:

```bash
# terminal 2
python service/test_api.py -f data_samples/DOC_LINE_CATEG/CTX000000001.csv
```

`keybert` is the best/default backend. If its preflight fails at runtime the
service **degrades once to `yake`** and reports `method_requested` vs
`method_used` rather than failing the enrichment.

### Layout inputs

The TEITOK the service returns has the layout of what it was given (issue
[#38](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich/issues/38)); `layout_source` in the envelope says which:

| Upload                                 | `layout_source` | The TEITOK                                                                                         |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.csv`/`.xlsx`/`.txt`                  | `rows`          | one `<pb>` per page and one `<lb>` per line of the input; no boxes, no facsimile, no page images   |
| `.csv`/`.xlsx` + `alto`                | `alto`          | as the CLI with `INPUT_ALTO_DIR`: word, line and block boxes, `<facsimile>`, `<figure>`s           |
| a TEITOK `.xml` converted by flexiconv | `teitok`        | as the CLI with `FLEXICONV_ANNOTATE=true`: its pages, lines and word boxes, its page images' names |

* A **TEITOK upload** is text and layout at once: its rows (`teitok_read`) go through the
  pipeline as the document's table, and the file itself becomes that document's layout — the
  same claim the CLI's stage 1 makes. Convert PDF, DOCX, PAGE XML, hOCR, … to TEITOK with
  `api_flexiconv.sh` (CLI) first: flexiconv is GPL-3.0 and is **not** in the service image. A file
  that is not well-formed, or breaks TEITOK-core rules (duplicate ids, references that point
  nowhere), is refused with 422 and the diagnostics.
* An **`alto` part** goes with a `.csv`/`.xlsx` (e.g. alto-postprocess's `DOC_LINE_CATEG` table and
  the ALTO it was made from); with a `.txt` or a TEITOK file it is refused (422). A PAGE XML or
  hOCR file in its place is refused with the hint to convert it with `api_flexiconv.sh`.
* The `doc_id` is the file name without `.teitok.xml`, `.alto.xml` or the table extension.

### `POST /enrich_text` (JSON)

```json
{ "doc_id": "CTX1", "lines": ["Výzkum odhalil základy kostela.", "..."],
  "kw_method": "keybert", "num_keywords": 20, "format": "json",
  "document_json": { "...optional baseline record, inline..." } }
```

### The `document_json` accretion part

Rule 1 of the document-JSON contract (the hub's `docs/document_schema.md`, issue
[atrium-llm-enrich#13](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-llm-enrich/issues/13)): a service **accepts
and returns an optional `document_json` part**. `/enrich` and `/jobs` take it as an upload part;
`/enrich_text` takes it as an embedded object.

When supplied, the response's `document_json` carries the record back with only
nlp-enrich's contribution merged in — its `entities[]` rows, whose `teitok_ref` is the
entity's `<name id>` (`n-1`, …) in the returned TEITOK — while every other tool's block
(`page_categories`, `lines`, `translations`, `enrichment`, …) passes through **untouched**.
(`pages[].teitok_surface`, the `<surface id>` `facs-P` of a page, is written for pages that
have a surface: with an `alto` part, or a TEITOK upload whose pages name an image or a size.)
This is the same accretion the CLI performs via
`run_pipeline.py --document-json/--document-json-out`; the service simply threads the flags
through to it, so there is one implementation, not two.

* Omit the part and the key is **absent** from the envelope — not `null`. Existing clients
  see no change at all.
* Supply it and get `null` back, and the pipeline produced no record (no CoNLL-U reached the
  document hook, or the hook failed and degraded per rule 3). `run_pipeline.py` prints
  `[document-json] NOT WRITTEN` on stdout in that case; the service's `stages` and the
  pipeline log say why.
* A baseline that does not validate against `atrium_document.schema.json` is still accepted
  (rule 6): the pipeline warns, names the schema error, and accretes onto it anyway rather
  than turning one bad upstream record into a stalled pipeline.

### JSON envelope

```json
{
  "doc_id": "...", "pages": 2,
  "stages": [ {"script": "api_4_stats", "successfully_processed": 1, ...} ],
  "teitok_xml": "<?xml ...>",
  "keywords": [ {"keyword": "...", "score": 0.91} ],
  "ne_summary": [ {"file": "...", "page": "1", "entities": [...] } ],
  "paradata": { "...merged pipeline-run record incl. license union..." },
  "method_requested": "keybert", "method_used": "keybert",
  "llm": null,
  "layout_source": "rows",
  "teitok_schema_valid": true, "teitok_schema_errors": [],
  "document_json": { "...only when a baseline was supplied..." }
}
```

`layout_source` is `rows`, `alto` or `teitok` ([Layout inputs](#layout-inputs)).
`teitok_schema_valid`/`teitok_schema_errors` are the output-contract verdict on `teitok_xml`
(`validate_teitok_xml.py`'s default `contract` profile); a run whose TEITOK fails the contract
never gets here — stage 4 stops with exit code 5, answered as 500.

`format=zip` instead streams the full workspace `OUTPUT_DIR`
(`TEITOK/`, `UDP_NE/`, `KW_PER_DOC_*/`, summary CSVs, `paradata/`, and
`<doc_id>.document.json` when a baseline was supplied).

### `POST /rescale` (multipart form)

A standalone coordinate transform — **not** part of the NLP pipeline (no
subprocess, no models, no workspace). Given a TEITOK document and the size of its page
images, it rescales every facsimile coordinate (the `bbox="x1 y1 x2 y2"` pixel boxes,
`pb@bbox` and the `<surface>` `lrx`/`lry` extents) from the document's own coordinate space,
page by page, so annotations line up exactly on top of images of that size. Each box is
scaled by the `<surface>` of the page it is on (the one its `<pb corresp>` names, or the k-th
surface for the k-th `<pb>`) and clamped to that page; `clamped` counts the coordinates that
had to move. A `<change type="rescaled">` in `<revisionDesc>` records the transform. This works for both coordinate origins the writer offers
(`BBOX_ORIGIN=page`, the default, and `printspace`): in both, `<surface>` declares the
extent the boxes are measured in.

| Field       | Default    | Notes                                                                                                                             |
|-------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file`      | *required* | a `.teitok.xml` (or `.xml`)                                                                                                       |
| `width`     | —          | target image width in pixels (1–`MAX_RESCALE_DIM`), with `height`                                                                 |
| `height`    | —          | target image height in pixels (1–`MAX_RESCALE_DIM`), with `width`                                                                 |
| `scale`     | —          | instead of `width`/`height`: every page image is this fraction of its `<surface>` (0–100); required when the pages differ in size |
| `format`    | `json`     | `json` envelope, or `xml` to download the rescaled `.teitok.xml`                                                                  |
| `fix_names` | `true`     | repair malformed `<name>…</n>` closings to `</name>`                                                                              |

The **source** coordinate space is read from the document itself: each page's
`<surface>` `lrx`/`lry` (the authoritative page extent); `width`/`height` are refused (422)
for a document whose surfaces differ in size — they would distort some pages — so give
`scale` there. Without any sized `<surface>` it falls back to the maximum extent of all `bbox`
boxes (`source_kind: "bbox-extent"`, approximate). The transform is a surgical,
text-level rewrite that only touches the numeric values, so it is robust to the
non-well-formed quirk of older TEITOK exports (named entities open `<name>` but close
`</n>`; the current writer closes `</name>`) that makes a strict XML parse fail.

Because that `</n>` quirk produces invalid XML, the endpoint also **repairs it by
default** — rewriting stray `</n>` closings to `</name>` so the returned document
parses cleanly (`name_tags_fixed` reports how many were fixed). This is a no-op
on already-valid TEITOK. Pass `fix_names=false` to leave the markup byte-for-byte
as-is and only rescale coordinates.

```bash
curl -s -F "file=@CTX000000001.teitok.xml" -F "width=827" -F "height=1170" \
     http://localhost:8000/rescale            # JSON envelope
curl -s -F "file=@CTX000000001.teitok.xml" -F "width=827" -F "height=1170" \
     -F "format=xml" -OJ http://localhost:8000/rescale   # download rescaled XML
curl -s -F "file=@mixed_pages.teitok.xml" -F "scale=0.5" \
     http://localhost:8000/rescale            # pages of different sizes
```

`format=json` response:

```json
{
  "teitok_xml": "<?xml ...>",
  "source": { "width": 1654, "height": 2339 },
  "source_kind": "surface",
  "target": { "width": 827, "height": 1170 },
  "scale": { "sx": 0.5, "sy": 0.500214 },
  "pages": [
    { "surface": "facs-1", "source": { "width": 1654, "height": 2339 }, "target": { "width": 827, "height": 1170 } },
    { "surface": "facs-2", "source": { "width": 1654, "height": 2339 }, "target": { "width": 827, "height": 1170 } }
  ],
  "boxes_rescaled": 37,
  "clamped": 0,
  "name_tags_fixed": 0,
  "schema_valid": true, "schema_errors": []
}
```

`source`, `target` and `scale` describe the first page; `pages` lists every page with a sized
`<surface>`.

## How it works

`PipelineManager` treats `run_pipeline.py` as the **only** execution interface —
it never calls the stage scripts directly. Each request gets a fresh workspace
under `TEMP/api_jobs/<job_id>/` with every pipeline directory relocated inside
it, so resume / paradata-collision / `FAIL_ON_EMPTY` semantics behave as a clean
first run and concurrent requests can't collide. Every input form is normalized
to a canonical `text[,page_num,line_num]` CSV so stage 1 always runs on the same
path and no input type bypasses a mandatory step.

The runner's exit codes map to HTTP: `0`→200; `3` (keyword preflight)→retry with
`yake`, else 503; `4` (keyword backend failed at runtime)→503; `5` (the TEITOK failed its
output contract — a writer defect, "please report it")→500; `1` (empty run)/`2` (missing
stage)/other→502; oversize→413; queue full→429; an unusable upload→422.

UDPipe/NameTag models stay operator-pinned in `config_api.txt` and are surfaced
read-only via `/info`. The layout comes with the upload ([Layout inputs](#layout-inputs)):
an uploaded TEITOK file is written to `<workspace>/layout/flexiconv/<doc_id>.teitok.xml`
(`TEITOK_FLEXICONV_DIR`, `FLEXICONV_ANNOTATE=true`), an `alto` part to
`<workspace>/layout/alto/<doc_id>.alto.xml` (`INPUT_ALTO_DIR`); both are outside `in/`, which
stage 1 reads as tables. Page images are never uploaded, so a surface keeps the size its
layout declares.

`PORT` and `HOST` are read by `service/api.py`'s `__main__` block, which is what the `api`
image's `ENTRYPOINT` (`python -m service.api`) runs. Before issue #58 the entrypoint baked
`--port 8000` into an exec-form array — which runs no shell, so `$PORT` could not expand —
while `service/healthcheck.py` read it. Setting `PORT` therefore moved the health *probe*
and not the listener, and the container reported unhealthy forever.

> ⚠️ `HOST=127.0.0.1` yields a container that reports **healthy** and serves nobody:
> `service/healthcheck.py` always probes loopback by design and never reads `HOST`, so a

## Shutdown behavior (issue #55)

The `api` image declares `HEALTHCHECK` (shallow `GET /health`, via the vendored
`service/healthcheck.py`) and `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`, and sets `ENV GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_S=20`,
which `service/api.py`'s `__main__` block passes to uvicorn as
`timeout_graceful_shutdown`. (It was the `--timeout-graceful-shutdown 20` CLI flag until
issue #58 moved the whole start command into that block so `$PORT` could be honoured.)

On `SIGTERM` the service:

1. flips `GET /ready` to **503** immediately, so an orchestrator stops routing new
   requests here (`GET /health` deliberately stays 200 — a liveness probe failing
   mid-shutdown would get the container killed before it finished draining);
2. lets uvicorn drain in-flight HTTP requests (up to 20s);
3. **then waits up to a further 25s for any background `/jobs` run to finish.** This
   step is what a plain in-flight-request count cannot do: `POST /jobs` returns
   `{"status": "queued"}` straight away, so the request is long gone while the job is
   still running. Jobs are registered with `ServiceState.track()`
   (`service/atrium_service.py`) specifically so shutdown waits for them.

⚠️ A job that needs longer than that drain budget is still cut short, and the job
**record** is in-memory (`service/jobs.py`) — so a client polling `/jobs/{id}` across a
restart gets 404 rather than a result. Durable job storage is out of scope here (hub
issue #53, factors IV/VI). See `docs/k8s_deployment.md` in the hub for the full
grace-period budget and the Kubernetes probe contract.

The container exits **143** (128 + SIGTERM) after a clean shutdown, not 0 — uvicorn
re-raises the captured signal on purpose so a supervisor sees the real cause. That is a
normal stop, not a crash.

## Tests

`tests/test_api_service.py` is fully hermetic (no LINDAT, no models): it
monkeypatches the pipeline subprocess to drop fixture outputs into the
workspace, then exercises the full HTTP contract via FastAPI `TestClient`,
plus input normalization, `doc_id` sanitization, and exit-code→HTTP mapping.
`tests/test_rescale.py` covers the `/rescale` transform and endpoint (including
the non-well-formed `<name>…</n>` TEITOK quirk and documents whose pages differ in size).
`tests/test_service_layout_inputs.py` runs the real stage-1 and stage-4 scripts in the
service's workspace (UDPipe/NameTag stood in for) with a TEITOK upload, a table with and
without its ALTO, and the refused combinations.

```bash
pytest -m "not slow" tests/test_api_service.py tests/test_rescale.py tests/test_service_layout_inputs.py
```
