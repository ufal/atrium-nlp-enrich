# NLP enrichment API service

Single-file entry point for the ATRIUM NLP enrichment pipeline (issue
[#8](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich/issues/8)): upload ordered text
lines, get back enriched **TEITOK XML + keywords + paradata**. The four core
stages (`manifest → udp → nt → stats`) always run; **LLM enrichment is excluded
from every API entry point**.

## Quick start

```bash
./setup_api_service.sh                 # venv + deps + KeyBERT prefetch + serve
# or, manually:
pip install -r requirements.txt -r service/requirements.txt
uvicorn service.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Two-terminal smoke test:

```bash
# terminal 2
python service/test_api.py -f data_samples/DOC_LINE_CATEG/CTX000000001.csv
```

## Endpoints

| Method | Path           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                      |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/`            | minimal landing page (see `/docs` for OpenAPI UI)                                                                                                                            |
| GET    | `/info`        | service id, endpoints, stage plan, pinned models, keyword methods + default, limits                                                                                          |
| GET    | `/health`      | liveness — 200 always, even mid-shutdown. `?deep=true` adds config validity via `run_pipeline.py --dry-run` + UDPipe/NameTag reachability (503 on failure or while draining) |
| GET    | `/ready`       | readiness — 503 until warmup finishes, 200 while serving, 503 the instant `SIGTERM` arrives. The Kubernetes `readinessProbe`/`startupProbe` target                           |
| POST   | `/enrich`      | **single-file entry point** — upload CSV/XLSX/TXT                                                                                                                            |
| POST   | `/enrich_text` | same pipeline for inline JSON                                                                                                                                                |
| POST   | `/rescale`     | rescale a single-page TEITOK's bboxes to a target image size                                                                                                                 |

### `POST /enrich` (multipart form)

| Field          | Default    | Notes                                                   |
|----------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `file`          | *required* | `.csv` (needs a `text` column), `.xlsx`, or `.txt`      |
| `kw_method`     | `keybert`  | `keybert` \| `yake` \| `legacy` \| `none`               |
| `num_keywords`  | `20`       | 1–100                                                   |
| `lang`          | `cs`       | Czech-pinned in v1                                      |
| `format`        | `json`     | `json` envelope, or `zip` of the workspace `OUTPUT_DIR` |
| `document_json` | *optional* | baseline ATRIUM Document JSON to accrete onto — see below |

`keybert` is the best/default backend. If its preflight fails at runtime the
service **degrades once to `yake`** and reports `method_requested` vs
`method_used` rather than failing the enrichment.

### `POST /enrich_text` (JSON)

```json
{ "doc_id": "CTX1", "lines": ["Výzkum odhalil základy kostela.", "..."],
  "kw_method": "keybert", "num_keywords": 20, "format": "json",
  "document_json": { "...optional baseline record, inline..." } }
```

### The `document_json` accretion part

Rule 1 of the document-JSON contract (`docs/document_schema.md`, issue
[#13](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-project/issues/13)): a service **accepts and returns an
optional `document_json` part**. `/enrich` and `/jobs` take it as an upload part;
`/enrich_text` takes it as an embedded object.

When supplied, the response's `document_json` carries the record back with only
nlp-enrich's contribution merged in — its `entities[]` rows and `pages[].teitok_surface` —
while every other tool's block (`page_categories`, `lines`, `translations`, `enrichment`, …)
passes through **untouched**. This is the same accretion the CLI performs via
`run_pipeline.py --document-json/--document-json-out`; the service simply threads the flags
through to it, so there is one implementation, not two.

* Omit the part and the key is **absent** from the envelope — not `null`. Existing clients
  see no change at all.
* Supply it and get `null` back, and the pipeline produced no record (no CoNLL-U reached the
  document hook, or the hook failed and degraded per rule 3). `run_pipeline.py` prints
  `[document-json] NOT WRITTEN` on stdout in that case; the service's `stages` and the
  pipeline log say why.
* A baseline that does not validate against `atrium_document.schema.json` is still accepted
  (rule 6): the pipeline warns, names the schema error, and accretes onto it anyway rather
  than turning one bad upstream record into a stalled pipeline.

### JSON envelope

```json
{
  "doc_id": "...", "pages": 2,
  "stages": [ {"script": "api_4_stats", "successfully_processed": 1, ...} ],
  "teitok_xml": "<?xml ...>",
  "keywords": [ {"keyword": "...", "score": 0.91} ],
  "ne_summary": [ {"file": "...", "page": "1", "entities": [...] } ],
  "paradata": { "...merged pipeline-run record incl. license union..." },
  "method_requested": "keybert", "method_used": "keybert",
  "llm": null,
  "document_json": { "...only when a baseline was supplied..." }
}
```

`format=zip` instead streams the full workspace `OUTPUT_DIR`
(`TEITOK/`, `UDP_NE/`, `KW_PER_DOC_*/`, summary CSVs, `paradata/`, and
`<doc_id>.document.json` when a baseline was supplied).

### `POST /rescale` (multipart form)

A standalone coordinate transform — **not** part of the NLP pipeline (no
subprocess, no models, no workspace). Given a single-page TEITOK document and a
target page-image size, it rescales every facsimile coordinate (the hOCR-style
`bbox` boxes and the `<surface>` `lrx`/`lry` extents) from the document's own
coordinate space to the requested size, so annotations line up exactly on top of
an image of that size.

| Field       | Default    | Notes                                                            |
|-------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `file`      | *required* | a single-page `.teitok.xml` (or `.xml`)                          |
| `width`     | *required* | target image width in pixels (1–`MAX_RESCALE_DIM`)               |
| `height`    | *required* | target image height in pixels (1–`MAX_RESCALE_DIM`)              |
| `format`    | `json`     | `json` envelope, or `xml` to download the rescaled `.teitok.xml` |
| `fix_names` | `true`     | repair malformed `<name>…</n>` closings to `</name>`             |

The **source** coordinate space is read from the document itself: the first
`<surface>` that declares `lrx`/`lry` (the authoritative page extent); if none
is present it falls back to the maximum extent of all `bbox` boxes
(`source_kind: "bbox-extent"`, approximate). The transform is a surgical,
text-level rewrite that only touches the numeric values, so it is robust to the
non-well-formed TEITOK quirk (named entities open `<name>` but close `</n>`) that
makes a strict XML parse fail.

Because that `</n>` quirk produces invalid XML, the endpoint also **repairs it by
default** — rewriting stray `</n>` closings to `</name>` so the returned document
parses cleanly (`name_tags_fixed` reports how many were fixed). This is a no-op
on already-valid TEITOK. Pass `fix_names=false` to leave the markup byte-for-byte
as-is and only rescale coordinates.

```bash
curl -s -F "file=@CTX000000001.teitok.xml" -F "width=827" -F "height=1170" \
     http://localhost:8000/rescale            # JSON envelope
curl -s -F "file=@CTX000000001.teitok.xml" -F "width=827" -F "height=1170" \
     -F "format=xml" -OJ http://localhost:8000/rescale   # download rescaled XML
```

`format=json` response:

```json
{
  "teitok_xml": "<?xml ...>",
  "source": { "width": 1654, "height": 2339 },
  "source_kind": "surface",
  "target": { "width": 827, "height": 1170 },
  "scale": { "sx": 0.5, "sy": 0.500214 },
  "boxes_rescaled": 37,
  "name_tags_fixed": 12
}
```

## How it works

`PipelineManager` treats `run_pipeline.py` as the **only** execution interface —
it never calls the stage scripts directly. Each request gets a fresh workspace
under `TEMP/api_jobs/<job_id>/` with every pipeline directory relocated inside
it, so resume / paradata-collision / `FAIL_ON_EMPTY` semantics behave as a clean
first run and concurrent requests can't collide. Every input form is normalized
to a canonical `text[,page_num,line_num]` CSV so stage 1 always runs on the same
path and no input type bypasses a mandatory step.

The runner's exit codes map to HTTP: `0`→200; `3` (keyword preflight)→retry with
`yake`, else 503; `1` (empty run)/`2` (missing stage)/other→502; oversize→413;
queue full→429.

UDPipe/NameTag models stay operator-pinned in `config_api.txt` and are surfaced
read-only via `/info`. ALTO/page-image inputs are unusable for text-only API
input, so TEITOK is produced **without** bounding boxes (a warning, not an
error).

## Configuration (environment)

| Variable                       | Default   | Meaning                                          |
|--------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS`          | `2`       | concurrent pipeline runs (also shields LINDAT)   |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`                | `5`       | upload size guard                                |
| `MAX_WORDS`                    | `30000`   | sync request word cap                            |
| `MAX_RESCALE_DIM`              | `100000`  | max target width/height for `/rescale`           |
| `DEFAULT_KW_METHOD`            | `keybert` | default keyword backend                          |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`              | `*`       | CORS origins                                     |
| `API_KEEP_WORKSPACES`          | unset     | keep per-request workspaces for debugging        |
| `ATRIUM_RUNNER_IMAGE/REPO/REF` | —         | forwarded to the runner for provenance           |
| `PORT`                         | `8000`    | port `service/healthcheck.py` probes (issue #55) |

## Shutdown behavior (issue #55)

The `api` image declares `HEALTHCHECK` (shallow `GET /health`, via the vendored
`service/healthcheck.py`) and `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`, and its `ENTRYPOINT` passes
`--timeout-graceful-shutdown 20`.

On `SIGTERM` the service:

1. flips `GET /ready` to **503** immediately, so an orchestrator stops routing new
   requests here (`GET /health` deliberately stays 200 — a liveness probe failing
   mid-shutdown would get the container killed before it finished draining);
2. lets uvicorn drain in-flight HTTP requests (up to 20s);
3. **then waits up to a further 25s for any background `/jobs` run to finish.** This
   step is what a plain in-flight-request count cannot do: `POST /jobs` returns
   `{"status": "queued"}` straight away, so the request is long gone while the job is
   still running. Jobs are registered with `ServiceState.track()`
   (`service/atrium_service.py`) specifically so shutdown waits for them.

⚠️ A job that needs longer than that drain budget is still cut short, and the job
**record** is in-memory (`service/jobs.py`) — so a client polling `/jobs/{id}` across a
restart gets 404 rather than a result. Durable job storage is out of scope here (hub
issue #53, factors IV/VI). See `docs/k8s_deployment.md` in the hub for the full
grace-period budget and the Kubernetes probe contract.

The container exits **143** (128 + SIGTERM) after a clean shutdown, not 0 — uvicorn
re-raises the captured signal on purpose so a supervisor sees the real cause. That is a
normal stop, not a crash.

## Tests

`tests/test_api_service.py` is fully hermetic (no LINDAT, no models): it
monkeypatches the pipeline subprocess to drop fixture outputs into the
workspace, then exercises the full HTTP contract via FastAPI `TestClient`,
plus input normalization, `doc_id` sanitization, and exit-code→HTTP mapping.
`tests/test_rescale.py` covers the `/rescale` transform and endpoint (including
the non-well-formed `<name>…</n>` TEITOK quirk).

```bash
pytest -m "not slow" tests/test_api_service.py tests/test_rescale.py
```
