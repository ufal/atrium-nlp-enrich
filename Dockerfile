# ── Distro security patches, applied at build time ───────────────────────────
# `python:3.11-slim` is a floating TAG, and nothing in this ecosystem bumps it:
# no repo declares a `docker` dependabot ecosystem (docker_gha_roadmap.md, H6),
# so the base layer is whatever Docker Hub last rebuilt. On 2026-09-15 that layer
# carried perl-base 5.40.1-6 with three FIXABLE CRITICAL CVEs — CVE-2026-13221,
# CVE-2026-42496 and CVE-2026-8376, all fixed in 5.40.1-6+deb13u1. The release
# gate in atrium-project's docker-tool.reusable.yml ("Fail the release on fixable
# CRITICAL vulnerabilities") therefore failed on ALL THREE matrix targets of
# v0.20.2 (run 34970419474), and because the promotion step is `if: success()`,
# v0.20.2 was published by DIGEST ONLY: the `:0.20.2` and `:latest` tags were
# never applied. The same commit passed on `master` and on `test`, because the
# gate is `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')` — only a release is stopped.
#
# `upgrade` rather than `install --only-upgrade perl-base`, deliberately. The gate
# blocks on *fixable* CRITICALs — precisely those the distro already ships a patch
# for — so the fix that matches the gate's own definition is "apply the distro's
# available patches", not a package name that has to be edited by hand the next
# time a different one is announced.
#
# CACHE INTERACTION, which is what makes this hold rather than run once: the build
# uses `cache-from: type=gha`, so an apt layer high in the file would be served
# from cache forever and silently stop patching. It sits HERE, immediately after
# the ENV block that embeds ATRIUM_RUNNER_REF, because CI passes that as
# `github.ref_name` — a value unique to each release tag. The ENV layer therefore
# changes on every release, busting this layer with it, so every released image is
# scanned against a freshly patched base while day-to-day `test` pushes still hit
# the cache. Do not move this above the ENV block.
#
# One apt layer, not two: the upgrade and the install share a single `apt-get
# update`, so the package lists are fetched once and removed once.
# Guarded by tests/test_dockerfile_security_layer.py (atrium-project#53).

# nothing the ENTRYPOINTs reach imports a package only it carries, so it only added to all
# three images and to the Trivy surface the release gate scans. The tests run on the CI
# runner, never in an image. The `api` stage gets fastapi/pydantic (exact pins) and

# service/api.py's ServiceState.track() — not covered by this budget at all, since a
# job-submission request has already returned before the job finishes). --start-period
# on HEALTHCHECK below covers first-run model downloads; see docs/docker_gha.md §3.4
# and docs/k8s_deployment.md for the full grace-period budget this is sized against.
