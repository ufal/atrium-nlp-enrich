# Vocabulary management runbook

Every script that reads or writes the controlled vocabulary, what it does, when to run
it, and what must **not** be run blindly. Companion to
[`prompts/RUNBOOK.md`](../../prompts/RUNBOOK.md), which covers the prompt this term list
is injected into and the records the run writes back. Issue
[#6](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich/issues/6).

Two decision packages live beside the sheets they are built from. Each frames an open
question with numbers from this directory and decides nothing:

| Package                        | Question                                             | Sheets it reads                                                                    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `6.O3O4.decision-package.md`   | which excluded terms come back? (O3/O4)              | `exclusion_impact.csv`, `teater_subbranch_impact.csv`, `reinstatement_preview.csv` |
| `6.D-eval.decision-package.md` | what counts as a correct answer? (O2, the D1 rubric) | `specificity_pairs.csv`, `composite_pairs.csv`, `collision_review.csv`             |

Three tools, in dependency order:

| Tool               | Needs network      | Needs the document corpus | Writes                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `vocab_build.py`   | only for a harvest | no                        | the 14 vocabulary artifacts in this directory |
| `vocab_review.py`  | no                 | no                        | 8 review sheets (corpus-independent)          |
| `corpus_review.py` | no                 | **yes**                   | 3 evidence sheets + `corpus_review.meta.json` |

### What is in this directory

25 files, three kinds. Only the first kind is input; everything else is generated and is
overwritten without warning by the command in its row.

| Files                                                | Kind                                                                                                       | Written by                               |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| `{amcr,teater}_flat.{json,csv}`                      | **harvest** — every field the source gave us, 16 per record                                                | `vocab_build.py --source both` (network) |
| `{amcr,teater,union}_nested.json`                    | the vocabulary itself, grouped into facets                                                                 | `vocab_build.py --from-flat`             |
| `{amcr,teater,union}_nested.meta.json`               | provenance sidecar: source endpoints, record counts, `tool_version`, and the sha256 of both taxonomy files | `vocab_build.py --from-flat`             |
| `{amcr,teater,union}_placement_audit.csv`            | one row per term: which rule placed it, and where                                                          | `vocab_build.py --from-flat`             |
| `vocabulary.csv`                                     | the union as one flat spreadsheet, for reading outside the repo                                            | `vocab_build.py --from-flat`             |
| the 8 review sheets (§2)                             | evidence for an open question                                                                              | `vocab_review.py --all`                  |
| the 3 corpus sheets + `corpus_review.meta.json` (§3) | evidence from real report text                                                                             | `corpus_review.py --all`                 |
| `6.*.decision-package.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`              | prose                                                                                                      | hand-written                             |

**`union_nested.json` is the one the pipeline reads** (`VOCAB_PATH` in `llm_config.txt`).
The per-source `amcr_nested.json` / `teater_nested.json` are the same nesting applied to
one source alone — useful for seeing what each contributes, read by nothing at runtime.

---

## 1. `vocab_build.py` — build the vocabulary itself

Two stages. Stage 1 (harvest) is the only thing that touches the network; stage 2
(nesting) is pure and offline.

```bash
# Everyday case: re-nest from the committed flat harvests after editing the taxonomy.
python3 vocab_build.py --from-flat            # rewrites data_samples/vocab/*
python3 vocab_build.py --from-flat --check    # exit 0 = artifacts match the config
python3 vocab_build.py --from-flat --stats    # per-facet counts + which rule placed what

# Refresh the source data (needs api.aiscr.cz + raw.githubusercontent.com).
python3 vocab_build.py --source both --teater-mode snapshot
```

**The rule that matters:** any edit to `taxonomy_config.json` or
`taxonomy_overrides.json` must be followed by `--from-flat`, in the same commit.
Config and artifacts moving separately is exactly what commit `a5e3c8a` did — the
config dissolved the `Documentation` facet while the shipped vocabulary still offered
all 107 of its terms to the model, and nothing failed. `--from-flat --check` is the
gate; it runs in CI (`.github/workflows/vocab-drift.yml`) and as
`tests/test_vocab_build.py::test_committed_artifacts_match_a_fresh_build`.

`--update-legacy` additionally writes `data_samples/teater_nested_vocab.json` (the
pre-union path). The refresh workflow does not pass it, so that file keeps diverging;
do not rely on it.

## 2. `vocab_review.py` — the eight reviewer sheets

Offline, pure, deterministic. Reads the committed `*_flat.json` plus the taxonomy
config; writes only the CSVs below. Nothing here decides anything — each sheet ranks
and surfaces candidates for a human.

```bash
python3 vocab_review.py --all            # all eight
python3 vocab_review.py --collisions     # collision_review.csv        (M8/M13, @david-spacil)
python3 vocab_review.py --composites     # composite_pairs.csv         (O1/F)
python3 vocab_review.py --exclusions     # exclusion_impact.csv        (O3/O4, @motyc)
python3 vocab_review.py --subbranches    # teater_subbranch_impact.csv (O3/O4, finer grain)
python3 vocab_review.py --reinstate      # reinstatement_preview.csv   (O3/O4 go/no-go)
python3 vocab_review.py --specificity    # specificity_pairs.csv       (D1/O2, @motyc)
python3 vocab_review.py --budget         # context_budget.csv          (which models still fit)
python3 vocab_review.py --census         # facet_census.csv            (A1-facets, @david-spacil)
```

Two of the eight are **empty or near-empty on purpose** right now, and that is not a
broken report: `teater_subbranch_impact.csv` decomposes *excluded* TEATER branches and
M11 reinstated all of them, and `exclusion_impact.csv` is down to the 23 settled AMCR
lists. Both come back the moment something is excluded again.

Re-run after **any** taxonomy change, for the same reason as the artifacts:
`tests/test_vocab_review.py::test_committed_review_sheets_match_a_fresh_generation`
fails if a committed sheet no longer matches the config it claims to describe.

Reading `collision_review.csv`: 308 rows / 136 groups on the current build, sorted by
`dissimilarity` ascending. Check `aat_verdict` before spending time on a row —
`agreeing` means both records align to the same Getty AAT concept and can be
bulk-confirmed as one; `conflicting` is positive homonym evidence.

**The ranking is the weaker signal, and M13 proved it.** Of @david-spacil's 7 splits
only 1 was in the dissimilarity top 30, while all 3 `conflicting` groups split. Read
`aat_verdict` first and treat `dissimilarity` as a tie-breaker.

> ⚠️ **`malta` — a live homonym that no column flags, and the one worth looking at
> first.** M11 reinstated the 250 country names, which brought `amcr:HES-001366`
> (*Malta*, the country) into a label group already held by three mortar records.
> `record_sort_key` sorts AMCR before TEATER and low ident first, so the bare label
> `malta` goes to `HES-000910` — **mortar, in `Material`** — and the country survives
> only as a `discarded_ids` entry on it. The country `Malta` is currently **not
> selectable by the model at all**, and `teater_category_ids` would report a line about
> Malta as a Material term.
>
> Both signals point the wrong way here: all four records read `aat_verdict = agreeing`
> (the class this runbook tells you to deprioritise), and the glosses *mortar* / *Malta*
> are far enough apart that dissimilarity does not rank them together either. The fix,
> if @david-spacil rules it a split, is one `qualifier_cs` on `HES-001366` — but which
> member carries the qualifier is the part **nothing checks**: putting it on the mortar
> record instead builds green, validates, and separates the wrong concept.

Reading `facet_census.csv`: one row per facet, in render order. `cumulative_tokens` is
the column that explains truncation — a facet is cut when everything *ahead* of it has
spent the budget, not when its own size crosses it — and `top_rules` names the exact
`heslar_map` / `teater_branch_map` values a re-layout would flip. This is the sheet for
**A1-facets**.

## 3. `corpus_review.py` — evidence from the documents ⚠️

**This is the one with a footgun.** It reports what the vocabulary actually matches in
real report text — the evidence standard @motyc set for excluding a branch (M3).

```bash
python3 corpus_review.py --all               # all three sheets
python3 corpus_review.py --term-evidence     # corpus_term_evidence.csv
python3 corpus_review.py --branch-evidence   # corpus_branch_evidence.csv  (O3/O4)
python3 corpus_review.py --gold-workbook     # gold_workbook.csv           (D1/D2)
```

### The corpus is not in git

`data_samples/DOC_LINE_CATEG` and `data_samples/UDP` track only three **synthetic**
demo documents (`CTX000000001-3`, 91 tokens). The real 16 reports (`CTX192100040`,
`CTX195603828`, …) arrive as the zip attachment on issue
[#19](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich/issues/19) and are untracked. So:

- On a machine with the real corpus, these sheets are **evidence** (19 documents,
  2172 lines).
- On a clean checkout, they are a **smoke test** (3 documents, 4 hits).

Every run prints its corpus size before writing anything — read that line first:

```
  [corpus] 19 document(s), … tokens, … distinct lemmas, 101/1017 single-word terms hit
```

`corpus_review.meta.json` records the corpus each committed sheet was built from, and
the tool **refuses to overwrite sheets built from a larger corpus** (exit 1) rather
than silently replacing real evidence with placeholder numbers. Restore the corpus, or
pass `--force` if shrinking really is intended.

> ⚠️ **The committed corpus sheets are stale, and the guard is why.**
> `corpus_review.meta.json` records `vocabulary_single_word_terms: 1017` — computed
> against the **2 074**-term vocabulary, before M11 reinstated 2 638 terms. Against
> today's 4 718 those denominators are wrong. They cannot be refreshed on a machine
> without the real corpus, because the guard correctly refuses to replace 19-document
> evidence with 3-document placeholders. **Re-run `python3 corpus_review.py --all` on
> the machine that has the issue #19 documents** and commit the result; it is a
> ten-minute job and nothing else in the repo can do it.

### Reading `corpus_branch_evidence.csv` — `unique_*`, not the totals

Read `unique_occurrences` / `unique_hit_term_count`. They count only labels that no
kept list already offers. The plain `occurrences` total includes labels that collide
with an offered term, where the hit is explained by the term already in the
vocabulary, not by the excluded branch.

The reason this matters: when it was generated, `heslar:zeme` (the 250 country names —
O3/O4 Q1, the branch the geographic guardrail existed for) scored **7 occurrences, all
of them the word `malta`**. In those lines `malta` is *mortar*
("spojovaných vápennou maltou"), an offered Material term; the record being credited was
the country `Malta`, which casefolding makes indistinguishable. Quoted as a total, that
row argues country names are attested in archaeological reports. Its
`unique_occurrences` is **0**.

`heslar:letiste` and `heslar:nalez_typ` are the **opposite** shape, and the same rule
says so: `letiste` scores `unique_occurrences` 3 / `shared` 0 and `nalez_typ` 21 / 0.
Their hits are not explained away by an offered term — read as evidence, they count.

Matching is lemma-based (`data_samples/UDP/*.conllu`, UDPipe `czech-pdt-ud-2.15`), and
covers **single-word terms only** — `zlomek keramiky` is never matched.

---

## Making the A1-facets call — the one decision still open

@david-spacil owns where the 2 638 terms M11 reinstated actually live. Today the tooling
proposes two facets at `priority: 0`, both last in render order:

| Facet                           | Terms | Holds                                                                |
|---------------------------------|------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Cultural & Geographic Context` |   972 | Q1 — countries, ethnic groups, historical regions, dynasties         |
| `Related Disciplines & Society` | 1 666 | Q2 — cross-disciplinary, professions, society, theory, battles, wars |

That is a **proposal, not a ruling**. `facet_census.csv` is the sheet to rule from:
`top_rules` names exactly the map values a different layout would flip, and
`cumulative_tokens` shows what each facet costs where it sits.

### The move, and what catches a mistake

```bash
$EDITOR data_samples/taxonomy_config.json    # 1. change teater_branch_map values;
                                             #    declare any NEW facet with priority + in_prompt,
                                             #    and list it in tie_break
python3 vocab_build.py --from-flat           # 2. rebuild
python3 vocab_review.py --all                # 3. refresh all eight sheets
python3 prompt_template.py --write           # 4. prompt_full.txt contains every term
python3 -m pytest -q                         # 5. all gates
```

Four things are checked for you, and each reports rather than guesses:

| Mistake                                                                    | Caught by                                                                                       |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Facet name typo in a map value                                             | `validate_settings` — *undeclared facet*                                                        |
| A renamed facet still named in `tie_break`, `heslar_labels` or an override | `validate_settings` — every stale reference, all at once                                        |
| A new facet sharing a priority but missing from `tie_break`                | `validate_settings` — render order would be decided by fallback, not by you                     |
| Config edited, artifacts or sheets not regenerated                         | `vocab_build.py --from-flat --check`, the review-sheet drift test, `prompt_template.py --check` |

**Priority is the load-bearing part, not the facet name.** Render order *is* truncation
order: the prompt keeps the largest fitting *prefix*, so a facet's position decides
whether a 32k model sees it at all. Q2 sitting last is M11's *evaluate later if problems
arise* made concrete — it is the first thing a tight budget drops, and retiring it is one
map value. Move it up the order and that property is gone; that is a decision worth
making deliberately, which is why the tie_break guard exists.

**What is *not* checked:** whether the grouping is *right*. No test knows that `bitvy`
belongs with professions rather than with chronology. That is the ruling, and it is why
the sheet exists.

## Order of operations after a taxonomy change

```bash
$EDITOR data_samples/taxonomy_config.json      # or taxonomy_overrides.json
python3 vocab_build.py --from-flat             # 1. rebuild the vocabulary
python3 vocab_build.py --from-flat --check     # 2. must exit 0
python3 vocab_review.py --all                  # 3. refresh the reviewer sheets
python3 prompt_template.py --write             # 4. refresh the committed prompt sheets
python3 corpus_review.py --all                 # 5. ONLY with the real corpus present
python3 -m pytest -q                           # 6. all gates
git add data_samples/vocab data_samples/taxonomy_*.json prompts && git commit
```

Step 4 is not optional when the vocabulary moved: `prompts/prompt_full.txt` contains every
term, so any taxonomy change makes it stale, and `prompt_template.py --check` fails in CI.
The same applies to a `PROMPT_*` flag or a `prompts/system_prompt.txt` edit, where steps
1–3 change nothing but step 4 does.

Skip step 5 if you do not have the real documents — the guard will refuse anyway, and
that refusal is correct, not a failure to work around.

## Where a decision gets recorded

Every decision below is a config edit. None of them needs a code change, and the build
refuses rather than guesses when an edit would not do what it says (`validate_settings`
reports every problem at once, not one per rebuild).

| Decision                                       | Goes in                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A whole AMCR list / TEATER branch in or out    | `taxonomy_config.json` → `heslar_map` / `teater_branch_map`, **plus** a `_exclusions` entry stating `status` and `reason` when the value is `__exclude__`                                                                                                                                      |
| Whether an exclusion is still an open question | `_exclusions[rule].status` — `settled`, `open_geo_ethnic` (Q1), `open_other` (Q2). Drives the `status` column of `exclusion_impact.csv`                                                                                                                                                        |
| One term's facet                               | `taxonomy_overrides.json` → `facet`, keyed on `(source, id)` — never on the bare label                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| One term's sub-header                          | `taxonomy_overrides.json` → `sub`. Give the rendered Czech label (`druh objektu`, not `objekt_druh`), and prefer one the target facet already uses                                                                                                                                             |
| One term out, inside a list worth keeping      | `taxonomy_overrides.json` → `facet: "__exclude__"`. Applied before dedup, so a term another kept record also offers survives under that record                                                                                                                                                 |
| A bracketed homonym qualifier                  | `taxonomy_overrides.json` → `qualifier_cs`. Only after a human has confirmed the split — most same-label collisions are one concept (`collision_review.csv`)                                                                                                                                   |
| Two entries mean the same thing / do not       | `taxonomy_overrides.json` → `same_as` / `same_as_suppress`. Shows up as `link_status` in `composite_pairs.csv`; neither changes what the prompt offers                                                                                                                                         |
| Reinstating a geographic branch                | three edits in **one** change: `PROMPT_GEO_GUARDRAIL=preference`, `geo_guardrail.active` false, flip the branch. Any one alone fails the build. Done for Q1+Q2 under M11                                                                                                                       |
| What splits a composite `X/Y` label            | `taxonomy_config.json` → `composite_separators`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Which keys reach the prompt payload            | `taxonomy_config.json` → `nested_keep`. `discarded_ids` and `bare_cs` are read back by the enrichment output, so dropping either changes behaviour                                                                                                                                             |
| What counts as boilerplate for truncation      | `taxonomy_config.json` → `admin_stop_words`. Sorts matching terms to the back of their facet, which decides what a small-context model still sees                                                                                                                                              |
| Facet order and priority                       | `taxonomy_config.json` → per-facet `priority`, `tie_break`. Load-bearing: the prompt truncates a *prefix* of the flattened term list, so position decides what a small-context model sees. Every facet sharing a priority with another **must** be listed in `tie_break`, or the build refuses |
| Which instruction reaches the model at all     | `prompts/system_prompt.txt` holds the text as `[[blocks]]` in render order; `llm_config.txt`'s `PROMPT_*` flags choose which render. The run banner prints the on/off list                                                                                                                     |
| The geographic guardrail's wording             | `llm_config.txt` → `PROMPT_GEO_GUARDRAIL` = `strict` / `preference` / `off`, paired with `taxonomy_config.json` → `geo_guardrail.active`. `vocab_build.py` renders the selected block and refuses a build where the two disagree                                                               |
| What one enrichment record looks like          | `prompts/output_template.json` — the committed shape of `<doc_id>_enriched.json`, held in step with the schema and the prompt's own examples by test                                                                                                                                           |
| **Reading the prompt without a GPU run**       | `python3 prompt_template.py --blocks` (what is on) · `--preview` (instructions, terms elided) · `--full` (the whole prompt, all 4 718 terms) · `--diff KEY=A KEY=B` (what a flag change does to the wording). All four are committed under `prompts/`                                          |
| **A committed sheet after any prompt change**  | `python3 prompt_template.py --write`, then commit `prompts/prompt_*.txt`. `--check` is the gate, and `vocab-drift.yml` runs it on every PR, so a stale sheet fails CI rather than misleading a reviewer                                                                                        |
| **Whether the facet grouping matters**         | `llm_config.txt` → `PROMPT_VOCAB_GROUPING` = `facet_sub` / `facet` / `flat`. Same terms, same truncation; only the headers move. `facet` vs `flat` isolates the headers, `facet_sub` vs `facet` the source's second level. Costs 126 terms at 32k, nothing at 128k                             |
| **Whether a model can still hold it**          | `context_budget.csv` — per context window and facet, how much survives truncation. At 32k only the probation facet is cut; at 8k 419 of 4 718 terms reach the model                                                                                                                            |
| **Which facet a reinstated branch lands in**   | `taxonomy_config.json` → the `teater_branch_map` value, **plus** the facet's own `priority` / `in_prompt` block if it is a new one. `facet_census.csv` is the evidence: contents, feeding rules, cost and cut point, one row per facet. This is **A1-facets**                                  |
| Nothing                                        | a generated CSV. Every sheet in this directory is rebuilt from the two files above; hand-editing one is discarded on the next run.                                                                                                                                                             |
