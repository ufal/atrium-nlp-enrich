| **v0.19.0** | **AMCR + TEATER controlled-vocabulary harvest and build.** New `vocab_sources.py` (OAI-PMH walk on an lxml parser with entity expansion and network access disabled) and `vocab_build.py` (pure nesting; `--from-flat --check` proves the artifact is reproducible from the committed flat files alone), driven by a new monthly `vocab-refresh.yml` on a hosted runner because the machines the pipeline usually runs on cannot reach `api.aiscr.cz`; union artifacts land under `data_samples/vocab/`, covered by `test_vocab_sources.py` / `test_vocab_manager.py` over pinned fixtures. The nightly now runs the **full suite** — it previously ran `pytest -m slow` against a repo with zero slow-marked tests and explicitly tolerated exit 5, so it reported success having collected nothing. `openpyxl` declared in `requirements-test.txt`, unlocking a test that had skipped since it was written. Re-vendored `atrium_document.py`; concurrency scoped by `github.event_name`. Bumps: sentence-transformers, vllm, bitsandbytes. | Pre-release |
| **v0.18.3** | Re-vendored `atrium_document.py`: `DocumentRecord` now **inherits `doc_id` from the baseline** instead of overwriting it with the caller's derivation. This release also closes **J3**, the gap v0.18.2's own row names: `/enrich` now accepts and returns a `document_json` part instead of shelling out to `run_pipeline.py` without either flag, so the API path finally has the coverage the CLI path had. Also in this window: TEITOK XML validated against its XSD (`api_util/validate_teitok_xml.py` plus the `teitok-schema` workflow, issue #28), `canonical_doc_id()` adopted across `build_manifest_row.py`, `summarize_nt_udp.py`, `teitok_alto.py`, `teitok_read.py` and `run_pipeline.py`, `entities[].type_cnec: null` fixed, and `tests/test_document_originators.py` -> canonical shared set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Pre-release |
| **v0.18.2** | `atrium_document` JSON input-output refined and tested against the draft schema **on the CLI path only** — `run_pipeline.py --document-json/--document-json-out`, bridged onto the `stats` stage, and exercised by the hub's end-to-end GHA pipeline. The API service was **not** covered: it shelled out to `run_pipeline.py` without passing either flag, so `/enrich` neither accepted nor returned a `document_json` part (atrium-project#10, J3 — fixed after this release).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Pre-release |

## 🌿 Branches & Environments

| Branch   | Environment          | Rule                                                                            |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `test`   | Staging              | Base for all development. Always branch from `test`.                            |
| `master` | Stable / Integration | Merged exclusively by a human reviewer. Do not open PRs directly into `master`. |

```text
test    ←  feature-<name>
test    ←  bugfix-<name>
master  ←  (humans only, after test stabilises)

```

### 🏷️ Branch Naming

| Type             | Pattern          | Example              |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| New feature      | `feature-<name>` | `feature-teitok`     |
| Bug fix          | `bugfix-<name>`  | `bugfix-chunking`    |
| Hotfix on master | `hotfix-<name>`  | `hotfix-api-timeout` |

---

## 🔁 Contributor Workflow

1. **Create an issue** (or find an existing one) describing the problem or feature.
2. **Branch from `test`:**
```bash
git checkout test
git pull origin test
git checkout -b feature-<name>
```
3. **Implement your changes** observing the project's code conventions.
4. **Run the minimum tests** (see the Testing section).
5. **Open a Pull Request** targeting the `test` branch.

---

## 📋 Pull Request Format

Every PR must include:

* **Issue link:** `Closes #<number>` or `Refs #<number>`
* **Motivation:** why the change is needed
* **Description of change:** what was changed and how
* **Testing:** what was run, what passed, what could not be executed

Use a **Draft PR** if the work is not ready for review.

**Do not open PRs into `master` — merging into `master` is exclusively the
maintainers' responsibility.

> **Note on issue tracking:** Issues reference the commits and PRs that resolved
> them — not the other way around. Commit messages describe *what changed*; the issue
> is the place to record *why* and link the resulting commits together.

## 🧪 Code Conventions & Testing

### Code Conventions

* **Comments:** informative but short, may be LLM-generated, added when function name does
not explain its functionality in detail
* **Argument types:** set default type (e.g., `int`, `list`) for function arguments
* **Console flags:** when a new one added, provide help message for it
* **Config files:** when set of variables changes it should be reflected in repository documentation
* **Generated code:** always should be manually launched and checked for mistakes before pushing

### Minimum checks before every commit

Always run basic validation locally before pushing:

```bash
# 1. Python compilation check
python -m compileall -q .

# 2. Lint & format (Ruff — matches CI)
ruff check .
ruff format .

# 3. Shell-script lint
shellcheck -e SC1091 api_*.sh api_util/*.sh setup_api_service.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
>  If specific scripts or extraction modules are updated, please run a smoke-test
> against the `data_samples/` directory to verify extraction integrity.

---

### Running the test suite

The repository ships a lightweight `pytest` harness that requires **no ML models or GPU**
for standard unit tests. Heavy tests that do require models or network access are marked
`slow` and are excluded from the default run.

```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt  # pytest>=8.0 and pytest-cov only
```

```bash
pytest -m "not slow" --tb=short                              # fast — use before every commit
pytest --tb=short                                            # full suite (requires model setup)
pytest -m "not slow" --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing      # with coverage
```

`tests/test_paradata.py` (`ParadataLogger`, `_sanitise`) is shared across all repos.
Repo-specific modules and GPU-heavy tests are marked `@pytest.mark.slow` and skipped by default.

<summary>Test layout, per-repo targets, and fixture conventions</summary>

├── conftest.py              # shared fixtures (tmp_path wrappers, sample data loaders)

**Per-repo targets:**

| Repository                | Test file           | Primary targets                                                                                                                                    |
|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `atrium-nlp-enrich`       | `test_keywords.py`  | `_extract_surface_text`, `_extract_lemmas`, `_extract_legacy`, `extract_keywords`, `_sort_csv_file`                                                |
| `atrium-alto-postprocess` | `test_text_util.py` | Density/ratio helpers, detectors, `pre_filter_line`, `parse_line_splits`, `categorize_line` (ppl passed directly, no GPU), `compute_quality_score` |
| `atrium-alto-postprocess` | `test_utils.py`     | `directory_scraper`, `dataframe_results` (Top-1 and Top-N), `collect_images`                                                                       |
| `atrium-translator`       | `test_utils.py`     | `_resolve_namespaces`, `validate_xml_with_xsd`, `process_alto_xml`, `process_amcr_xml` (mock translator injected)                                  |

**Slow tests** — any test loading a model checkpoint, calling an external API, or requiring a GPU must be decorated with `@pytest.mark.slow`. Document in the PR description which resource it requires and how to enable it locally.

**Fixtures** — small, self-contained files committed under `tests/fixtures/`. Tests must not read from `data_samples/` directly. Add a minimal fixture file in the same commit as any test that needs new sample data.

## 📁 Repository Documentation Management

Each documentation file has one target audience and one responsibility. Rules are not repeated — cross-references are used instead.

| File              | Audience        | Responsibility                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `README.md`       | GitHub visitors | Project overview, workflow stages, quick start |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Developers      | Code conventions, branches, PRs, testing       |

* **Do not duplicate rules:** if a rule is defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, other files
reference it rather than copying it.
* **When changing a rule:** update the canonical source and verify that referencing files
still point correctly.

## ⚙️ Generated Artefacts

Some files are modified automatically by scripts or hooks:

| Script              | What it generates                                      |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `api_1_manifest.sh` | `manifest.tsv` — ordered list of all pages to process  |
| `api_2_udp.sh`      | `UDP/*.conllu` — per-document CoNLL-U files            |
| `api_3_nt.sh`       | `NE/*/*.tsv` — per-page NER-annotated TSV files        |
| `api_4_stats.sh`    | `UDP_NE/`, `TEITOK/`, `summary_ne_counts.csv`          |

Rules:

1. Do not manually edit auto-generated output files.
2. After changing chunking logic, re-run `api_2_udp.sh` to verify CoNLL-U validity.
3. After changing NER merging logic or TEITOK XML composition, re-run `api_4_stats.sh`
and inspect `summary_ne_counts.csv`.

---

## 🚩 Output Format Flags

Pipeline output is controlled by boolean flags in `config_api.txt`. When adding a new output format,
follow this pattern:

| Variable         | Description                                              | Default |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `SAVE_CONLLU_NE` | Enriched CoNLL-U with NER in the `MISC` field            | `true`  |
| `SAVE_CSV`       | Token-level summary CSV per document                     | `true`  |
| `SAVE_TEITOK`    | TEITOK-style TEI XML with bounding boxes (requires ALTO) | `true`  |

New flags must be documented here and in `config_api.txt`.
