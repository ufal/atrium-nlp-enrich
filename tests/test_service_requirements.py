"""
tests/test_service_requirements.py
==================================
The service's runtime manifest declares everything the service is launched with
(atrium-project#10, G3).

``service/requirements.txt`` carried six test/contract deps and **no ASGI server** for
twelve days while three separate launch paths — ``Dockerfile``'s ``api`` ENTRYPOINT,
``docker-compose.yaml``'s ``nlp-api`` profile, and ``setup_api_service.sh`` — all invoke
``uvicorn``. Nothing in CI could see it, and the reason is structural rather than
accidental:

* the API contract tests drive the app **in-process** through ``TestClient``, which never
  starts a server, so a missing server is invisible to them by construction;
* ``docker-build-smoke`` only **builds** the image and never runs it, so a broken
  ENTRYPOINT is invisible to it too.

Both blind spots are about *running* the thing. This file takes the other route and checks
the manifest against the launch commands themselves — cheap, hermetic, and it fails the
moment someone prunes a requirements file again. It deliberately reads the real
Dockerfile/compose/setup-script text rather than hardcoding "uvicorn", so switching the
server (hypercorn, granian, …) keeps the gate honest instead of making it a lie.
