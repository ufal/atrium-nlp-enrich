"""
tests/test_docs.py — the documentation's checkable claims (issue #6).

Prose goes stale silently. Most of it can only be kept honest by reading it, but a
useful slice is mechanical: a link either resolves or it does not, a file either exists
or it does not, and a count either matches the code or it does not. Those are here.

The provoking case: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `data_samples/vocab/RUNBOOK.md`
all linked to `prompts/RUNBOOK.md` — in a table of contents, in a config comment, and in
a "which document is for whom" table — while the file did not exist. Three documents
promised a fourth into being and nothing noticed, because no test reads a link.

Deliberately narrow. This module asserts what a reader can verify without judgement;
whether the prose is *right* is a review question, not a test.
