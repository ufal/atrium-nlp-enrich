vocab_review.py — read-only review artifacts for issue #6's open vocabulary questions.

Five independent reports. Each is a CSV a domain reviewer reads and turns into either
a ``taxonomy_overrides.json`` entry or a ``teater_branch_map``/``heslar_map`` flip.
Nothing here writes to the vocabulary itself, and none of the five guesses a semantic
verdict — they rank and surface candidates; a human still decides.

    python3 vocab_review.py --collisions    # M8: same-label groups that might be homonyms
    python3 vocab_review.py --composites    # O1/F: "X/Y" labels vs. standalone X, Y
    python3 vocab_review.py --exclusions    # O3/O4: impact of reinstating each excluded list
    python3 vocab_review.py --subbranches   # O3/O4: the same, one level finer-grained
    python3 vocab_review.py --reinstate     # O3/O4: usable_count / collisions / token delta
    python3 vocab_review.py --all           # all five, offline from the committed flat files

Offline and pure: reads ``data_samples/vocab/*_flat.json`` + the taxonomy config, never
touches the network, never writes anywhere but the report CSVs.

    two numbers a global re-nest would tell you — how many NEW enum entries appear,

    exact set operations against the real, already-built baseline vocabulary, which

    ``raw_count`` vs ``usable_count`` is the discrepancy
    ``6.O3O4.decision-package.md`` had to explain in prose (1708 raw vs 1703 usable
    for Q2) — this sheet makes it a column pair instead, per rule:

    * ``usable_count`` — distinct normalised labels in the branch that are NOT
      already offered under any facet today. This is how many NEW enum entries
      reinstating the rule would add.
    * ``collides_with_offered`` — labels that ARE already offered. These do not add
      a new entry (B1 dedup would absorb the reinstated record as a
      ``discarded_id`` on whichever term already carries that label); it is still
      useful to a reviewer as a sign the branch overlaps existing content.

    ``would_be_facet`` is intentionally left blank — the tool never picks a facet on
    a reviewer's behalf (P2); it is the one column a human fills in once Q1/Q2 name a

    hierarchy and the facet rollup keeps both tiers, so a large share of the TEATER side

    ``build_system_prompt`` renders the facets in priority order and, when the result
    exceeds the budget, keeps the largest fitting **prefix** of the flattened term list.
    So a facet is not dropped because it is unimportant — it is dropped because it sits
    late in the order, and everything after the cut goes with it. That makes "which
    model are we running?" a vocabulary question, not just an infrastructure one, and it
    is the concrete form of M11's *evaluate later if problems arise*: the 2 638
    reinstated terms sit last by design, so they are the first thing a tight budget
    removes.

    The overhead of the instruction preamble and the examples is charged against the
    budget too, and taken from the *configured* prompt (``prompt_template``), so turning
    a block off in ``llm_config.txt`` shows up here as room for more terms. So are the
    group header lines, which are not free — the shipped two-level layout spends ~120 of
    them — and which is the whole of what ``PROMPT_VOCAB_GROUPING`` moves. A header is
    charged when the term that opens its group is reached, so a run that truncates
    mid-vocabulary is not billed for headers the model never sees.

    Estimated, not tokenised: no tokenizer is available offline, so this uses the same
